# Signup

When we sign up our account need to join to developer member of 1 company. But bogus one works.

- https://mp.weixin.qq.com/
- https://mp.weixin.qq.com/cgi-bin/registermidpage?action=index&lang=en_US&token=
- https://mp.weixin.qq.com/wxopen/waregister?action=step1&token=&lang=en_US

The you will be taken to: https://mp.weixin.qq.com/wxamp/home/guide?token={blah}

And then add your account to developer (might need to scan with phone WeChat)

And then you can use IDE to deploy (Simulator or USB to phone, though simulator isn't good though)

Download WeChat IDE: https://developers.weixin.qq.com/miniprogram/en/dev/devtools/download.html

For mobile debug: no need for driver nor usb-debug. Just need WeChat.

To develop and test-run on IDE: Preview button (eye), compile and preview.

To publish: submit app to WeChat. If they allow, your app will be on WeChat store.
